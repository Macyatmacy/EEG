This is a repo for a project on inner speech decoding with EEG data. We have compared too languages: English and Chinese.



Data: 
the 2~40 Hz data (withouth ICA): https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xwJEw1Da1R6QRPJjAojCsR_7ZgIVLVa4
we are uploading the other preprocessed data to the google drive and will update soon.

Content:
1. Language-specific neural decoding
2. Classification with feature-based methods and end-to-end methods (neural networks).
