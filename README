This is a repo for a project on inner speech decoding with EEG data. In the project, we have compiled a novel dataset to compared too languages: English and Chinese. Different neural representations of two native language groups have been explored with paired t tests, topographies and 3D localasation (with the software sLoreta).
Furthermore, both conventional methods (feature-based) and neural networks (end-to-end) have been evaluated on the the dataset, involving within-subject training, subject-independent training and transfer learning.

Content:
1. Language-specific neural decoding
2. Classification with feature-based methods and end-to-end methods (neural networks).

5 English native speakers and 7 Chinese native speakers were recruited in the project. We collected about 0ne-hour EEG data for each participant. 
One of the English speakers has participanted twice.

We have compared datasets with different preprocessing:
2~40 Hz without ICA applied
2~40 Hz with ICA applied
0.5~125 Hz without ICA applied
0.5~125 Hz with ICA applied

7 band groups are used to compare neural representations.
delta (0.5~4 Hz)
theta (4~8 Hz)
alpha (8~12 Hz)
beta (12~30 Hz)
low gamma (30~50 Hz)
median gamma (50~70 Hz)
high gamma (70~125 Hz)

Implementation of the codes:
Data: 
the 2~40 Hz data (withouth ICA): https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xwJEw1Da1R6QRPJjAojCsR_7ZgIVLVa4
we are uploading the other preprocessed data to the google drive and will update soon.

Code:
The Matlab code is mainly for preprocessing and visulization, and the Python code for model training.

There is a 'top_coding.m' file which controls the processing pipeline from raw data to data input for training, with most input and output in the cells to be data path.
How to use:
1. Add the whole code folder to Matlab path.
2. Put the raw '.csv' files of each subject into a single folder. And put the folders with subject data into a folder. Change matlab path to that folder and strart from 'topfolder = pwd;'; or start with the data in the google drive and set:
fil_folder_name = 'fil_2_40' and update EEG_paths;
3. Follow the instruction in the 'top_coding.m' file to do any processing.

For RCSP, it is implemented in matlab and the functions are in the RCSP folder.

For FBCSP and any neural networks, data should be prepared with Matlab into '.gdf' format, and input into the Python code.
