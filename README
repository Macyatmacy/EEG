This is a repo for a project on inner speech decoding with EEG data. We have compared too languages: English and Chinese.



Data: we are uploading the preprocessed data to a google drive and will update the link here soon.

Content:
1. Language-specific neural decoding
2. Classification with feature-based methods and end-to-end methods (neural networks).
